                        The accuracy of the data provided directly impacts the quality of our services and compliance

                <!-- Fees & Payment -->
                <h4>5. Fees & Payment</h4>
                <p>
                    All service fees will be transparently outlined in your official service agreement, proposal, or
                    engagement letter before the commencement of work.
                    Our pricing structure may vary depending on the scope of work, jurisdiction, and complexity of the
                    engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payments must be made in the designated currency as specified—Indian Rupee (INR), Singapore Dollar
                    (SGD), or Malaysian Ringgit (MYR)—using
                    authorized and secure payment methods such as bank transfers, online payments, or invoicing
                    platforms approved by Hisho & Kanri Pvt Ltd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients are expected to settle invoices by the due date mentioned in the agreement. Delayed payments
                    may attract interest charges,
                    administrative fees, or, in some cases, suspension of services until outstanding dues are cleared.
                    Consistent non-payment may result in
                    termination of services and legal recovery measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For long-term or recurring services, we may issue invoices on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis,
                    as agreed upon in the engagement.
                    Any revisions to the fee structure will be communicated in advance with mutual consent.
                </p>

                <!-- Termination of Services -->
                <h4>6. Termination of Services</h4>
                <p>
                    Either party—Hisho & Kanri Pvt Ltd or the client—reserves the right to terminate the service
                    engagement by providing
                    a formal written notice. The required notice period may vary depending on the specific terms
                    outlined in the service agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon termination, all work in progress will cease, and the client will be invoiced for any services
                    rendered up to the date of termination.
                    Any outstanding payments must be settled within fifteen (15) business days from the termination
                    date, unless otherwise stated in the agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In cases of breach of contract, unethical conduct, misuse of confidential information, or repeated
                    failure to comply with payment terms,
                    Hisho & Kanri Pvt Ltd reserves the right to terminate services immediately without prior notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All documents and client records in our possession will be returned or securely disposed of upon
                    request, subject to applicable data
                    retention and legal compliance policies in India, Singapore, or Malaysia.
